      <h2>Chapter 1: Early Days</h2>
      <p>My name is Emman Vincent M. Palma Gil, born on July 1, 2002. I was born in Cotabato City, a place full of vibrant energy and inspiring landscapes although my family needed to move away from that place so now me and my family are staying in Cebu. My childhood was filled with curiosity, imagination, and the warmth of my family. Whether it was playing with my neighbors and friends or being on my own watching movies, those times were filled with happiness.   </p>
      
      <h2>Chapter 2: School Days</h2>
      <p>Growing up, school became my second home. From making lifelong friends to experiencing my first big challenges, each day brought a new adventure. I discovered my love for Art, which continues to be a passion to this day, even if I rarely make my own nowadays. My teachers always encouraged me to dream big and work hard, especially the people who taught me many numerous things and gave me opportunities to grow. </p>
      
      <h2>Chapter 3: Discovering Hobbies</h2>
      <p>In my teenage years, I found a passion for Art, specifically, drawing. It gave me a sense of purpose and became a creative outlet. Through ups and downs, this passion taught me resilience and discipline. Unfortunately, with how my environment has been constantly shifting, I find it hard to just sit down and draw. </p>
      
            <h2>Chapter 3: The Present and Beyond</h2>
      <p>Today, I continue to pursue my dreams, both personal and academically. I strive to grow every day while maintaining a sense of gratitude for how far I’ve come. The future is filled with countless unknowns but it doesn't prevent me from doing what I think is best. </p>
